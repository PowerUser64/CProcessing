# CProcessing
See the Processing_Sample folder for the CProcessing source code and example project files.

On this branch (`linux`), Processing_Sample also includes some extras to aid in porting CProcessing to linux, such as

- a cmake build system
- definitions and defines for functions and macros normally found in
windows-specific headers, such as windows.h
